# Data Exploration and Visualization on Zomato Dataset (Bangalore)
Introduction
In this project, I performed data exploration and visualization on the Zomato dataset of Bangalore. Zomato is a popular online restaurant discovery and food ordering platform that provides information about restaurants, menus, user reviews, and ratings.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants). It contains information about 51717 restaurants in Bangalore, including their names, locations, cuisines, average cost for two people, ratings, votes, and more.

## Tools Used
The analysis was done using Python and various data analysis and visualization libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Data Cleaning
Before starting the analysis, I cleaned the data by removing missing values, duplicates, and unnecessary columns. I also standardized the data by converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

## Data Exploration
I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a better understanding of the data. I explored the distribution of restaurants across different locations and cuisines, the distribution of ratings and average cost for two people, and the correlation between various variables.

## Data Visualization
I used various visualization techniques to communicate the insights gained from the EDA. I created bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, heat maps, and interactive visualizations to showcase the data in a more engaging and understandable way.

## Some of the key insights gained from the analysis are:

The highest number of restaurants are located in BTM Layout, HSR, and Koramangala 5th Block.
North Indian and Chinese are the most popular cuisines in Bangalore.
There is a positive correlation between the rating and the number of votes a restaurant has received.
The average cost for two people is higher for fine dining restaurants compared to casual dining and quick bites.
Conclusion
In conclusion, data exploration and visualization on the Zomato dataset of Bangalore has provided valuable insights into the restaurant industry in the city. The analysis can be used by restaurant owners, food enthusiasts, and policymakers to make informed decisions about the food industry in Bangalore.
